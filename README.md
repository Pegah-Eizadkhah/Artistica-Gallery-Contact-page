# Artistica-Gallery-Contact-page
This is the contact page on the website I made as part of a team of 3 developers for Artistica art gallery in Dexter, MI. It uses Bootstrap, JavaScript and HTML, has an embeded google maps and a contact form that emails forms out to owners of the gallery and also includes social media buttons at the buttom of the page.
